A private fork is a copy of the Athena repository that contains your changes. It will only contain your changes if you know how utilize <code>git</code>. Which is a tool used for pushing changes to repositories.</p><p>As I&#39;ve stated dozens of times. If you are not familiar with these tools you will have a hard time working with them. Athena Framework will move forward without you and if you do not learn to use these tools your server will struggle with security updates.</p><h3 id="do-i-need-to-buy-a-server" tabindex="-1">Do I need to buy a server? <a class="header-anchor" href="#do-i-need-to-buy-a-server" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Do I need to buy a server?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In most cases NO. You do not need to buy a server. Your local machine will work just fine until you decide you want to add more users to your server. </p><p>When you are launching for a full community you should look into these items:</p><ul><li>A CDN to host your server resource downloads such as mods.</li><li>A Dedicated Server with Unmetered Up / Down</li><li>At least 4 cores.</li><li>At least 8 GB of RAM.</li><li>At least 256GB of Storage</li><li>A dedicated CPU</li><li>DDoS Protection</li><li>Ability to access a server with full CLI access.
